To create a business network using Hyperledger Fabric, you'll need to define the business network's assets, participants, transactions, and access control rules using Hyperledger Composer. Hyperledger Composer is a set of collaboration tools for building blockchain business networks. It makes it simple and fast for business owners and developers to create smart contracts and blockchain applications to solve business problems.

Here is a simple example of creating a business network using Hyperledger Composer:

1. **Install Hyperledger Composer**:

   Follow the instructions in the official documentation to install Hyperledger Composer: [Hyperledger Composer - Install](https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/latest/installing/installing-index.html).

2. **Create a New Business Network**:

   Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to create a new business network:

   ```bash
   composer init --name sample-business-network --description "Sample Business Network" --author "Your Name" --license Apache-2.0 --email "your.email@example.com"
   ```

   This command will create a new directory named `sample-business-network` with the necessary files.

3. **Define Assets, Participants, and Transactions**:

   In the `models/sample-business-network.cto` file, define the assets, participants, and transactions for your business network. For example:

   ```javascript
   namespace org.example.basic

   asset SampleAsset identified by assetId {
       o String assetId
       o String value
   }

   participant SampleParticipant identified by participantId {
       o String participantId
       o String firstName
       o String lastName
   }

   transaction SampleTransaction {
       --> SampleAsset asset
       o String newValue
   }
   ```

4. **Define Access Control Rules**:

   In the `permissions.acl` file, define access control rules to specify who can perform specific actions. For example:

   ```plaintext
   rule Default {
       description: "Allow all participants access to all resources"
       participant: "ANY"
       operation: ALL
       resource: "org.example.basic.*"
       action: ALLOW
   }
   ```

5. **Generate the Business Network Archive (BNA)**:

   Run the following command to create a Business Network Archive (BNA) file:

   ```bash
   composer archive create -t dir -n .
   ```

   This will generate a `.bna` file in the `dist` directory.

6. **Deploy the Business Network**:

   You can deploy the BNA file to a Hyperledger Fabric network. This requires a running Hyperledger Fabric environment.

   You can follow the official Hyperledger Composer documentation for instructions on deploying the business network: [Hyperledger Composer - Deploying a Business Network Archive (BNA)](https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/latest/business-network/deploying-bna.html).

7. **Start Interacting with the Business Network**:

   Once the business network is deployed, you can start interacting with it using the Composer REST Server, a web application that exposes the business network as a set of RESTful APIs.

   Follow the documentation on how to set up and use the REST server: [Hyperledger Composer - REST Server](https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/latest/integrating/getting-started-rest-api).

This is a basic example to get you started. In a real-world scenario, you would define more complex assets, participants, and transactions, as well as access control rules that align with your specific business requirements.
